## Latest update:
* Thanks to long-time Lua programmer [shawnjb](https://github.com/shawnjb) for the update
* Optimized Lua code
* Minified JSON files, resulting in a 50% reduction in file size
* Fixed all syntax errors
* Prerequisites for some Lua errors have been made

## How to format the files
Simply format the jbeam into cjson and the cs into torquescript on Visual Studio Code\
`{
    "files.associations": {
        "*.jbeam": "cjson",
        "*.cs": "torquescript"
    }
}`
